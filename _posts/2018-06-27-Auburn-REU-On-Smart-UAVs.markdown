The Auburn Research Experience for Undergraduates for Smart UAVs allows students to conduct meaningful research and dive into the life of a graduate student. I am very grateful that I get to experience this eight week program with ten other intelligent and passionate students. I hope you enjoy learning more about this program.



My Research!!
My team consisted of myself and two others. We used the deep learning algorithm A3C to develop navigation and object avoidance in simulated autonomous drones. Our main goal was to create intelligent autonomy and have the drones complete certain tasks. We used A3C for its asynchronous nature. This allowed us to run multiple agents at the same time thus optimizing our training process.  To accomplish this we had to complete a variety of tasks in a short amount of time. I used the Unreal game engine to create the simulated environments. I attempted to make them realistic so that the Reality Gap would hopefully be closed to some degree. We then used AirSim, a photo and physics realistic plug-in for Unreal by Microsoft, to control the drones. By combining AirSim and our custom built environments we were able to precisely train our drones in specific environments and situations.
